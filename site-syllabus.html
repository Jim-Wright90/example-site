<p><em>Note regarding obtaining clinical competency and alternative clinical education (ACE) credit:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Students must demonstrate competency in accordance with the ASHA KASA standards on specified competency items. If particular assignments or exam questions pertaining to these competencies do not demonstrate beginning competency, students may be asked to complete more work to demonstrate competency regardless of overall assignment or test grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Students will obtain clinical contact hours through alternative clinical education (ACE) methods in this course. Hence, students will be required to meet specific competencies on designated ACE class exercises in order to receive ACE hours. If competency is not met on ACE assignments, students may be asked to complete further work or they may not be able to claim clinical hours.</p></li>

<div id="course-format" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Format</h1>
<p>The course agenda is available on the course website. Please note that the dates for class topics may vary as we have an opportunity for discussions or clinical applications.The order of topics and readings will remain the same. Please check with the professors if you have any questions. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class activities and discussions. The course will be supported by Canvas and the course website. Students will be expected complete all assignments by the designated due date.</p>
</div>

<li>Basic understanding of research methodology sufficient for reading journal articles</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-components" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Components</h1>
<p><strong><em>Course Grade:</em></strong> Grades will be based on percentages received of the 215 point total as indicated below. The assignments and details on evaluation criteria are described in supplementary handouts. Final course grades may be calculated on a modified curve reflecting general class performance.</p>
<div id="graded-activities" class="section level2">
<h2>Graded Activities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>2 Midterm Exams:</em></strong> There will be two quizzes covering the information in lecture and readings. Students will evaluate each other’s responses in class and receive immediate feedback on concepts that are not clear immediately following the quiz. The two quizzes will be worth 60 cumulative points (30 points each exam).</li>
<li><strong><em>Systematic Instruction Portfolio:</em></strong> Due <em>February 25th</em>. Please see description on the assignments section of the course website. This assignment is worth 50 points.</li>
<li><strong><em>Direct Attention Training Assignment:</em></strong> Due <em>February 4th</em>. Please see description on the assignments section of the course website. This assignment is worth 25 points.</li>
<li><strong><em>SIMUCASE “Larry” (CVLT assessment):</em></strong> Due <em>March 10th</em>. Please see description of SIMUCASE write up under the assignments section of the course website. This assignment is worth 20 points.</li>
<li><strong><em>Review &amp; Chew Class Reading Discussions:</em></strong> Due as indicated on the course agenda. Please see description on the assignments section of the course website. There will be three “Review &amp; Chew” assignments each worth eight points, for a total of 24 points.</li>
<li><strong><em>PBE Assignment</em></strong>: Add description</li>
<li><strong><em>Student Engagement:</em></strong> Class participation is critical for synthesizing and applying information. Students are expected to attend every class and actively participate. Students will lose five class points for any missed lecture and 2 points for any class in which class expectations for etiquette, milieu, and engagement are not followed. Examples would be being tardy for class, interrupting a peer or speaker, texting or social media use during class etc. If emergency or illness prevents class attendance, students will need to alert professor prior and arrange for make-up work to be completed within three days of absence. Review &amp; Chew groups cannot be made up-See handout.</li>
<li><strong><em>Final Exam:</em></strong> An in-class, closed book examination will be administered with questions that require students to apply concepts learned in class. The exam will be worth 40 points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grading will occur as a percentage of total points. Decimals will be ignored.</p>
<ul>
<li>100% =A+ (225 points)</li>
<li>95-99 = A (214-224)</li>
<li>90-94 = A- (201-213)</li>
<li>87-89 =B+ (196-200)</li>
<li>84-86 =B (189-195)</li>
<li>80-83 =B- (180-188)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<div id="instructor-expectations-so-that-students-can-maximize-the-learning-experience" class="section level3">
<h3>Instructor Expectations so that Students Can Maximize the Learning Experience</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Approach class with an active, ready-to-learn, receptive stance.</strong> When students are curious, ask questions, remain non-defensive if provided with critical feedback, and actively engage with the material—they learn. Adopting a mindset of active learning versus passive receipt of material is critical.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Come prepared.</strong> This class is set up to build on the readings and give you a chance to apply the concepts. If you have not read the assignments, the lecture and application exercises will not be as useful. Students are expected to come having completed the assigned work to the best of their ability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observe standard classroom etiquette and clinical professionalism.</strong> Being punctual, not talking out of turn, and being respectful of all members of the classroom ensures a productive learning milieu. Please turn off your cell phones and do not have social network or email open on your computer during class. Students are expected to adhere to our Code of Ethics including confidentiality when discussing clinic cases. Observe the Diversity expectations listed below and contribute to an inclusive class climate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate with me as the instructor.</strong> Sometimes you may need some extra review or a concept is not clear to you. After you wrestle with the material, and you still need assistance, then come see me. I will always make time to assist with your learning if you are doing your part. I need to know if elements of the class are not working for you. Every student is different. It is your responsibility to communicate concerns to me as I have no other way of knowing. Sometimes an instructor inadvertently makes a statement that offends or hurts—that instructor needs to know this and be given a chance to apologize. Sometimes a student has an unforeseen circumstance that gets in the way of being prepared. Communicating with me allows us to make a plan so you can still learn the material. I request honest, open communication with my students.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate with your peers.</strong> Look around you today. The people in this class will be your peers in the field. It will not be me. I will be asking you to practice learning from each other. Your master’s program gives you only the most basic foundation to begin practicing. You will need to deepen your knowledge in specific areas and develop a plan for lifetime learning if you want to be a solid, and ideally, an excellent clinician. Part of this is learning how to network, and teach and learn from one another.</p></li>

</div>
<div id="student-expectations-of-instructor-to-maximize-student-learning-experience" class="section level3">
<h3>Student Expectations of Instructor to Maximize Student Learning Experience</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Approach class with an open, receptive attitude.</strong> I need to be ready to learn from you, my students. You may have information or resources that are new to me. If several students are letting me know they don’t understand material, I need to listen, be non-defensive and flexible in altering my teaching. I need to remember that: a) this is not the only class students are taking; b) not everyone learns in the same way or approaches their training in the same fashion; and c) sometimes life gets in the way, and my instructor expectations cannot be met. This does not mean that I alter my goals for what you learn, but I will try and find ways that work for each of you to do the work it takes to learn the material and apply it to your practice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Come prepared.</strong> My lectures should be organized. My reading list should be relevant. Class lectures should be tied to the reading and extend the information presented within. I should provide advance organizers to help you integrate the reading. The activities I ask you to do should provide you with practice in clinical decision making with sufficient structure so you practice relevant clinical skills. I should try and make the information interesting by providing actual clinical examples and tying lectures and exercises to actual clients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observe classroom etiquette and an inclusive milieu.</strong> I should be punctual and not talk when others are talking. As the instructor I am responsible for guiding discussions and ensuring a respectful atmosphere. I should make sure that all members of the class feel included and comfortable in participating in discussions and asking questions. If students express discomfort, I should take steps to remedy the situation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Facilitate Communication.</strong> I should be an active listener and an honest open communicator. If I have a concern, I should check it out directly with the student. If I make a mistake in my communication, I should apologize and ask for clarification on how to avoid misunderstandings in the future. I should make sure I am reasonably available by returning emails promptly and making space in my schedule for requested face to face meetings.</p></li>

<h2>Student Engagement Inventory</h2>
<p>Graduate Courses Graduate students are expected to perform work of higher quality and quantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each student credit hour.

<h1>Additional Information</h1>
<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students. To do so requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>promote a culture of respect throughout the University community.</p></li>
<li><p>respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.</p></li>
<li><p>reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.</p></li>
<li><p>practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>*promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.</p>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.</p>
</div>
<div id="indigenous-recognition-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>Indigenous Recognition Statement</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.</p>
</div>
<div id="using-pronouns-and-personal-preference" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Pronouns and Personal Preference</h2>
<p>The College of Education is always working to include and engage everyone. One way we can do this is to share our pronouns, or the words we want to be called when people aren’t using our name. Like names, pronouns are an important part of how we identify ourselves. Because we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary this practice can assist in promoting respectful communication. As a community, we are all learning together about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on campus. If you would like to ensure clarity around pronouns, please feel free to share any pronouns you would prefer me to use when referring to you to help me be aware of how to address you respectfully. <a href="https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns">Please visit this university website for more information.</a></p>
</div>
